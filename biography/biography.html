            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>
                I am <b>Iñigo Agunod</b>, and my childhood began in a quiet household that was always filled with activity and familiar routines.
                I grew up in a family of six, with my mother, my father, my two older brothers, my twin brother, and me all sharing the same busy space.
                Our days were shaped by habits and rhythms that gave a sense of order to our lives.
                I learned early on that <b>sharing</b> and <b>cooperation</b> were essential when living with many siblings.
                The house was filled with noise, conversation, and energy.
                Having a <i>twin brother</i> added a different dynamic to our family, with two older brothers above us.
                The environment often felt energetic and unpredictable.
                Each day brought lessons that slowly formed my early understanding of the world.
                When I started school, it was in a small school close to our home.
                The school was not large, but it carried a strong sense of community.
                I made friends quickly because most students knew each other and lived near each other.
                Some of the friendships I built during that time continued well beyond childhood, and a few still stay in touch with me today.
                My school life was full of simple joys, like playing during recess and talking with classmates between lessons.
                These moments helped me learn how to communicate and connect with others.
                Growing up in that environment taught me how to adapt to different personalities.
                Even the smallest experiences contributed to my growth and understanding as a person.
                Looking back, I can see how my childhood shaped my character and outlook.
                It taught me values that continue to influence my decisions today and formed the foundation of who I am becoming.

        <!-- TEENAGE -->
        <section id="teenage">
            <h2>Teenage</h2>
            <p>
                My teenage years began with the transition into high school, a period that gradually introduced me to new environments and responsibilities.
                As I moved through each grade, I learned more about myself and how I adapted to different situations.
                The start of the quarantine during my junior high years became an unexpected turning point.
                Being indoors for long periods taught me patience, discipline, and the ability to stay focused even when routines changed.
                Online learning required independence and strengthened my sense of responsibility.
                It also helped me understand the importance of staying connected with people despite physical distance.
                When face-to-face classes returned during grade eleven, the change felt both refreshing and challenging.
                I entered that stage with a renewed sense of self-awareness and confidence.
                Senior high school became a time of steady personal growth as I learned to trust myself more deeply.
                It also introduced me to new relationships and experiences that shaped my emotional maturity.
                Among the people I met during this time, one person stood out and left a <b>deep and meaningful impact</b> on my teenage years.
                Forming a relationship with her taught me valuable lessons about <i>communication, trust, and commitment</i>.
                Although that chapter eventually closed, the memories and lessons I carry today became part of my growth.
                Through that experience, I learned to appreciate people more and to value every shared moment.
                My teenage years strengthened my independence and ability to handle change.
                They taught me how to balance emotions, responsibilities, and aspirations.
                Looking back, those years were a blend of transition, discovery, and important milestones that prepared me for college.

        <!-- COLLEGE -->
        <section id="college">
            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>
                My college experience began with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement as I entered a new environment filled with unfamiliar people and expectations.
                At first, I did not have many friends because I lacked the confidence to approach others.
                I often worried about how people might perceive me, which made it difficult to initiate conversations.
                Despite these concerns, college felt refreshing because it gave me the chance to express myself more freely.
                I realized that most students were focused on their own responsibilities, which made the atmosphere less intimidating than I expected.
                Meeting new people gradually became easier as I learned to understand different personalities.
                College pushed me to grow academically, mentally, and emotionally.
                There were ups and downs, but each challenge strengthened my determination to do well in my studies.
                My interest in coding and technology grew stronger, and I learned many new concepts that expanded my skills.
                At the start of my first year, I joined the <i>ROTC program</i>, which significantly shaped my personal development.
                ROTC taught me discipline, leadership, and confidence.
                The training pushed me beyond my comfort zone and helped me overcome self-doubt.
                Through the program, I formed strong friendships that continue today.
                After one full year of training and commitment, I graduated from the program with a stronger sense of identity.
                My college years so far have been a combination of learning, growth, and self-discovery, and I look forward to the experiences still ahead.
