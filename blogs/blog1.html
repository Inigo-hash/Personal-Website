            As I started my <b>Computer Science journey</b>, I already expected that I would be using AI more since AI is everywhere and used by many.
            Using AI not only helps me understand topics faster but also speeds up the process of finishing schoolwork and personal projects.
            That's why in this blog, I'll be sharing <i>my experiences, struggles, and realizations using AI</i>.

        <p class="blog-text">
            AI, also known as <b><i>Artificial Intelligence</i></b>, is a popular tool that enables users to gain information quickly and efficiently.
            I started using AI when I was in senior high school.
            There were a lot of projects and essays that had to be finished in a short period of time, and because of my habit of procrastinating,
            I looked for tools that could help me finish tasks faster — and that's where I discovered AI.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
            At first, I was hesitant to use AI because many people told me it was inconsistent and unreliable.
            But after using it, I realized there was more to AI than just asking random questions.
            It helped me gather information faster, work more efficiently, and manage my time better.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
            However, AI is not perfect.
            There are times when it gives outdated or inaccurate information.
            Sometimes, when my prompt is unclear, the response I receive is different from what I expect.
            Learning how to ask good questions was a struggle, especially when I didn't know how to properly express what I wanted.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
            In conclusion, AI is a helpful tool that supports my learning and productivity.
            <i>It will not replace programmers</i>, but it will help us build programs faster and more efficiently.
            How we choose to use AI will determine how beneficial it becomes in the long run.
