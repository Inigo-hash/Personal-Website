      <p class="introduction">I didn't start playing <b><i>League of Legends</i></b> to learn patience, emotional control, or teamwork—but somehow, after thousands of games and just as many questionable teammates, I did. 
        Before League of Legends, I was a calm, optimistic human being. 
        After League of Legends, I learned the true meaning of suffering, perseverance, and typing "gg" when it was absolutely not a good game. After League of Legends, however, I learned the true meaning of suffering, perseverance, and the ability to keep playing despite the negative reaction from teammates. 
        Every match demands focus, adaptability, and emotional control, especially when your own teammates bad-mouth you, and facing constant pressure helped me respond to frustration. 
        Over time, the game became more than just an entertainment, it became an unexpected teacher that pushed me to grow as a person, both in-game and in real life despite the criticism I get from time to time.

    <!-- BODY -->
    <div class="body-container">
      <p class="body1">Before playing League of Legends, I rarely noticed how much patience and emotional control mattered in challenging situations. 
        Like most people, I found it easy to get annoyed when things didn't go as planned. 
        League of Legends quickly challenged that mindset. 
        In a game where matches can last around <b><i>30 minutes or more</i></b> and a single mistake can change the outcome of the game, losing my cool only makes things worse. 
        I learned that getting tilted, arguing in chat and getting banned for 1 week, or giving up early almost always lead to defeat. 
        Over the period of time, I realized that <i>staying calm</i> even when teammates made mistakes or the game seemed unwinnable, gave me a better chance to recover. 
        This habit slowly carried over into real life. 
        Instead of reacting immediately with frustration, I became better at pausing, thinking, and responding to situations more thoughtfully. 
        League of Legends taught me that patience isn't about waiting, <i>it's about keeping control when things don't go your way</i>.<br><br> 
        One of the biggest lessons that I learned from League of Legends is the <b>importance of teamwork</b>. 
        No matter how skilled one player is, winning a match depends on how five people play throughout the game, how well they play together and how well they adapt to each other. 
        Playing with teammates who have different <i>playstyles, strengths, and decision-making habits</i> forced me to adapt rather than expect everyone to think the same way I do. 
        I learned that <i>communication, whether through pings, quick messages, or simple encouragement</i> was far more effective than blaming other people's mistakes. 
        When teammates help each other out and motivate each other throughout the game, cooperation gives more teammates hope in winning that game.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <p class="conclusion">In conclusion, League of Legends may have tested my sanity, but also helped me grow as a person. 
      <i>Through constant challenges, mistakes, and intense matches</i>, I learned how to stay calm under pressure and work better with others. 
      The game showed me that winning is rarely achieved alone and that <i>patience and teamwork matter just as much as skill</i>. 
      Even though not every match was enjoyable, the lessons I gained from playing League of Legends continue to influence how I approach problems and relationships in real life. 
      When I get stressed, work with people who think differently, or mess up, I'm better at staying calm and not giving up right away. 
      In school, group projects, and everyday situations, I try to adjust, and keep going instead of reacting out of frustration. 
      League of Legends might just be a game, but the habits it taught me stuck around. 
      Those small lessons helped me grow as a person, and especially meet new people and build relationships with them.
