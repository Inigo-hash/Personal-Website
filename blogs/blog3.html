            <h1>Coding My Way Towards a Better Future</h1>

        <!--INTRODUCTION-->
        <h2>Finding Direction in an Uncertain Future</h2>
        <p>"<i>What are your plans after college?</i>" was a common question I was asked when I started college. 
            At first, I lacked a solid answer. 
            I simply knew that I desired a future in which I wouldn't have financial, mental, or professional problems. 
            As I became more familiar with code, technology, and the rapid evolution of the IT industry, I gradually began to picture the career path I wanted to pursue. 
            Even though it's still scary and uncertain, thinking about my career and future goals made me realize that I can't just keep wandering and hope things work out on their own.</p>

        <h2>The Career Path I Want to Pursue</h2>

        <p>I currently see myself working as a <b>software engineer</b> or a <b>cloud engineer in the future</b>, with cloud engineering being the path I'm leaning towards more. 
           I find it interesting that the majority of the services and apps people use on a daily basis are powered by cloud computing. 
           However, I'm also interested in software engineering since it focuses on developing solutions, creating logic, and transforming concepts into systems that work.
           I'm also open to the possibility of working as an <b>AI engineer</b> in the future. 
           Artificial intelligence is undeniably popular, and I'm interested in learning more about how it functions after witnessing how it's applied in real-world situations. 
           But I am aware that I must first build a solid foundation in order to reach that level. 
           I must start with the fundamentals, improve my skills in programming, and have a thorough understanding of how software and systems operate.</p>

        
        <h2>What I need to Do to Reach that Career</h2>

        <p>I am aware that merely passing my subjects in college is not enough to become a software or cloud engineer. 
           I need to gain more knowledge and actually apply it. 
           This means writing more code, working on projects, and focusing on a programming language that is in high demand in the field. 
           Projects are important since they provide practical experience rather than just theory and can help me stand out in future job applications. 
           One of the most important things I've learned is that I need to stop choosing <i>comfort over growth</i>. 
           Although I enjoy playing video games, I am also aware that doing so takes away time that could have been spent on studying or working on projects. 
           I will eventually fall behind, not improve my coding abilities, and risk not getting the career I want. 
           Time moves faster than I expect, it feels like just yesterday I was still in high school, and now I'm already in college.</p>

        <h2>My Future Goals After College</h2>

        <p>My short-term goal after graduation is simple but important: <b>land a job in the IT field</b>. I want to gain experience, learn from real-world work, and slowly build my confidence as a professional. 
           In addition to gaining experience, I aim to eventually earn a high-paying salary, not just for luxury but for stability and security in life. 
           One of my greatest long-term goals is to work abroad, especially in Europe. 
           Switzerland is my primary pick, but I'm also open to Finland, Sweden, or Germany. 
           My ideal home would be peaceful, less polluted, closer to nature, and offers a steady work-life balance. 
           One day, I see myself settling there, living a quiet and stable life while working in the tech industry. 
           Hopefully, Switzerland—if life allows it.</p>

        <h2>Fears, Doubts, and Reality Checks</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>To tell the truth, I'm afraid of what lies ahead. 
           "<i>What if I don't reach these goals</i>?" is a question I frequently ask myself or "<i>What happens if I make a mistake</i>?" 
           I don't consider myself very smart nor completely incapable either—I feel average. 
           Sometimes, I can't help but find myself comparing myself to those who appear to be smarter, faster, and more hard working than me.
           There are times when I really put in a lot of effort, take my studies seriously, and score high grades. 
           I'm proud of myself until I see how much better other people's scores are. 
           It makes me feel like my best effort is someone else's minimum, and that really hurts my confidence. 
           Because of that disappointment, I sometimes fall back into my comfort zone, which is avoiding studying and playing games instead. 
           I know it's a bad cycle, but recognizing it is already a step towards changing.</p>
        
        <!--CONCLUSION-->
        <h2>Choosing Growth Over Fear</h2>
        <p>Thinking about my career and future goals made me realize that fear and doubt will always be there—but so will choices. 
           I can either let fear stop me, or I can use it as motivation to work harder. 
           I may not be the smartest person in the room, but I know that when I put in real effort, I improve. 
           My goal now is to be more disciplined, focus on learning, build projects, and slowly move closer to the career I want. 
           The future is uncertain, and that is scary—but it's also exciting. 
           As long as I keep moving forward, learning, and trying again even when I fail, I believe I still have a chance to reach the life I'm aiming for.</p>
