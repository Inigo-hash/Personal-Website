    <h2 style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: #2C3639;">Childhood</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My childhood began in a quiet household but always filled with activity and familiar routines. 
        <sup>2</sup>I grew up in a family of six, with my mother, my father, my two older brothers, my twin brother, and me all sharing the same busy space. 
        <sup>3</sup>Our days were shaped by habits and rhythms that gave a sense of order to our lives. 
        <sup>4</sup>I learned early on that sharing and cooperation were essential when living with many siblings. 
        <sup>5</sup>The house was filled with noise, conversation, and energy. 
        <sup>6</sup>Having a twin brother added a different dynamic to our family. 
        <sup>7</sup>With two older brothers above us. 
        <sup>8</sup>The environment often felt energetic and unpredictable. 
        <sup>9</sup>Each day brought lessons that slowly formed my early understanding of the world. 
        <sup>10</sup>When I started school, it was in a small school that is close to our home. 
        <sup>11</sup>The school was not large, but it carried a strong sense of community. 
        <sup>12</sup>I made friends quickly because most students knew each other and lived close to each other. 
        <sup>13</sup>Some of the friendships I built during that time continued well beyond childhood. 
        <sup>14</sup>A few of the people I met back then still stay in touch with me today. 
        <sup>15</sup>My school life was full of simple joys, like playing during recess and talking with classmates between lessons. 
        <sup>16</sup>These moments helped me learn how to communicate and connect with others. 
        <sup>17</sup>Growing up in that environment taught me how to adapt to different personalities. 
        <sup>18</sup>Even the smallest experiences contributed to my growth and understanding as a person. 
        <sup>19</sup>Looking back, I can see how my childhood shaped my character and outlook. 
        <sup>20</sup>It taught me values that continue to influence my decisions today. 
        <sup>21</sup>My early years formed the foundation that helped me grow into the person I am becoming.

    <h2 style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: #2C3639;">Teenage</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My teenage years began with the transition into high school, a period that gradually introduced me to new environments and responsibilities. 
        <sup>2</sup>As I moved through each grade, I learned more about myself and how I adapted to different situations. 
        <sup>3</sup>The start of the quarantine during my junior high years became an unexpected turning point. 
        <sup>4</sup>Being indoors for long periods taught me patience, discipline, and the ability to stay focused even when routines changed. 
        <sup>5</sup>Online learning modality required a kind of independence that strengthened my sense of responsibility. 
        <sup>6</sup>It also helped me understand the importance of staying connected with people despite physical distance. 
        <sup>7</sup>When face-to-face classes returned during grade eleven, the change felt both refreshing and challenging. 
        <sup>8</sup>I entered that stage with a renewed sense of self-awareness and confidence. 
        <sup>9</sup>Senior high school became a time of steady personal growth as I learned to trust myself more deeply. 
        <sup>10</sup>It also introduced me to new relationships and experiences that shaped my emotional maturity. 
        <sup>11</sup>Among the people I met during this time, one person stood out and left a deep meaningful impact on my teenage years. 
        <sup>12</sup>Forming a relationship with her taught me valuable lessons about communication, trust, and commitment. 
        <sup>13</sup>She helped me understand how powerful genuine connection can be. 
        <sup>14</sup>Although that chapter eventually closed, the memories I created with her and lessons that I still carry till this day became part of my growth as a person. 
        <sup>15</sup>Through that experience, I learned to appreciate people more and to value every moment shared with them. 
        <sup>16</sup>My teenage years also strengthened my independence and ability to handle change. 
        <sup>17</sup>They taught me how to balance my emotions, responsibilities, and aspirations. 
        <sup>18</sup>Looking back, I see those years as a blend of transition, discovery, and important milestones. 
        <sup>19</sup>Each experience contributed to the person I was becoming. 
        <sup>20</sup>Ultimately, my teenage years prepared me for the new challenges and opportunities that awaited me in college.

    <h2 style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: #2C3639;">College</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My college experience began with a mixture of uncertainty and excitement as I prepared to enter a new environment filled with unfamiliar people and expectations. 
        <sup>2</sup>At first, I did not have many friends because I lacked the confidence to approach others. 
        <sup>3</sup>I often worried about how people might perceive me, which made it difficult to initiate conversations. 
        <sup>4</sup>Despite these concerns, stepping into college felt refreshing because it offered me the chance to express myself more freely. 
        <sup>5</sup>I realized that most students were focused on their own responsibilities, which made the atmosphere less intimidating than I expected. 
        <sup>6</sup>This helped me move around campus with fewer doubts and a great sense of comfort. 
        <sup>7</sup>Meeting new people gradually became easier as I learned to understand different personalities. 
        <sup>8</sup>College also gave me the opportunity to challenge myself academically and grow both mentally and emotionally. 
        <sup>9</sup>There were ups and downs, but each challenge strengthened my determination to do well in my studies. 
        <sup>10</sup>Staying focused on what mattered most allowed me to pass my subjects and continue moving forward. 
        <sup>11</sup>My interest in coding and technology grew stronger during this period, and I learned many new concepts that expanded my skills. 
        <sup>12</sup>As I moved through the year, I became more comfortable with the workload and routines of college life. 
        <sup>13</sup>At the very start of my first year, I joined the ROTC program, a decision that would significantly shape my personal growth. 
        <sup>14</sup>ROTC taught me discipline, leadership, and the importance of carrying myself with confidence. 
        <sup>15</sup>The training pushed me to overcome my own doubts and break out of my comfort zone. 
        <sup>16</sup>Through the program, I formed strong friendships that continue to this day. 
        <sup>17</sup>The people I met in ROTC became an important part of my college life. 
        <sup>18</sup>After one full year of training and commitment, I graduated from the program with a stronger sense of identity. 
        <sup>19</sup>That accomplishment marked a meaningful step in my development as a person. 
        <sup>20</sup>Looking back, my college years so far have been a valuable combination of learning, growth, and self-discovery. 
        <sup>21</sup>Even though I am still in my second year, I appreciate how far I have come and look forward to the experiences still ahead of me.
