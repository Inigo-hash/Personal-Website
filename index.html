            <p style="line-height: 2.4;">
                I'm a Computer Science student who is enthusiastic about creating innovative software solutions. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing game like League of Legends. A hobby that fuels my creativity and problem solving skills.<br><br>
                My goal is to work as a software engineer or cloud engineer, creating effective programs. I'm driven by the challenge of building scalable, effective systems and bringing ideas to reality through code.<br><br>
                In addition to my technical goals, I'd like to work overseas in Switzerland, where I can grow professionally while experiencing a new culture. I'm dedicated to learning new things continually and challenging myself to reach new heights in the tech industry.
